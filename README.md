# ciaopetro
My personal Django-based blog at ciaopetro.com. 

Feel free to use this as a template for creating a basic blog with the added functionality: 
- tagging ([django-tagging](https://github.com/Fantomas42/django-tagging/blob/develop/docs/index.rst))
- photo gallery ([django-photologue](https://github.com/jdriscoll/django-photologue))
- commenting (to come)
- automated xml sitemap ([Django builtin](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/ref/contrib/sitemaps/))
- flatpages (dynamically create new pages and routes through django admin, also a [Django builtin](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/ref/contrib/flatpages/))
- bootstrap ([style library](http://getbootstrap.com/))
